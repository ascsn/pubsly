# 1. Introduction

## Overview of Pubsly

Pubsly is a web-based application designed to help research groups and collaborations easily track, manage, and showcase their scholarly output. It provides a centralized platform for team members to log new publications (papers, articles, preprints) and presentations (talks, posters).

Pubsly aims to simplify data entry by leveraging metadata from external services like CrossRef (for DOIs) and arXiv, and by allowing bulk imports from common researcher profiles like ORCID and Google Scholar. It also offers features for data analysis, visualization, and export, making it a valuable tool for monitoring research progress and impact.

## Key Features

Pubsly offers a range of features to streamline the management of research contributions:

*   **Easy Data Entry:**
    *   Add publications quickly by parsing metadata from DOI or arXiv IDs.
    *   Manual entry forms for publications and presentations when automatic parsing isn't available or suitable.
*   **Bulk Import:**
    *   Import multiple publications at once from an ORCID profile.
    *   Import publications from a BibTeX file exported from Google Scholar or other reference managers.
*   **Comprehensive Data Management:**
    *   Store detailed information for publications (title, authors, year, source, abstract, URL, citation count) and presentations (title, speaker, date, location, link, associated file).
    *   Organize publications with a flexible tagging system.
*   **Data Visualization & Analytics:**
    *   View summary statistics about your research output (total publications, presentations, citations, etc.).
    *   Visualize trends with charts for publications over time and citations by publication year.
    *   Filter analytics by tags for more granular insights.
*   **Efficient Browsing & Filtering:**
    *   View all entries in a clear, sortable list.
    *   Filter publications by tags to quickly find relevant work.
*   **Data Export & Backup:**
    *   Export all portal data (publications and presentations) in JSON format for backup or transfer.
    *   Export publication lists in Plain Text and BibTeX formats for reporting or use in reference managers.
*   **Citation Tracking:**
    *   Automatically fetches citation counts from Semantic Scholar for publications with DOIs or arXiv IDs.
    *   Option to refresh citation counts, prioritizing entries where this data is missing.
*   **User Authentication (Optional):**
    *   If enabled, provides secure login via Auth0, distinguishing between public read-only views and authenticated full-access.
    *   If disabled, allows full access to all features without requiring login.
*   **Responsive Design:** Accessible and usable across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

This portal is designed to be a user-friendly tool to help your research collaboration stay organized and informed about its collective achievements.
