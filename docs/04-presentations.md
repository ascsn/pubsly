# 4. Managing Presentations

This section explains how to add, edit, and delete presentations in the Research Collaboration Portal. Access to these functions typically requires you to be logged in (if authentication is enabled).

## Adding a Presentation

1.  **Navigate:** Go to "Add Presentation" from the Navbar or the Home page.
2.  **Fill in the Form:** Complete the following fields:
    *   **Title (Required):** The full title of the presentation.
    *   **Speaker (Required):** The name of the person who gave the presentation. The field may be pre-filled with the name of the last speaker entered.
    *   **Date (Required):** The date of the presentation. Use the date picker or enter in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    *   **Location (Required):** The venue or event where the presentation was given (e.g., "Conference XYZ, City, Country", "University Seminar Series").
    *   **Link to Slides/Recording (Optional):** A URL pointing to online slides (e.g., Google Slides, Speaker Deck), a video recording, or other relevant materials.
    *   **Upload File (Optional):**
        *   You can associate a file (e.g., PDF of slides, poster) with the presentation.
        *   Click "Choose File" and select the file from your computer.
        *   **Note:** In the current version of the portal, the actual file content is *not* uploaded to a server. Only the file's name and type are stored for record-keeping. This is a common behavior for simple client-side applications.
3.  **Save Presentation:** Click the "Save Presentation" button.
    *   The presentation will be added to the portal.
    *   You will be redirected to the "View Entries" page, where your new presentation will appear.

**Duplicate Check:** The system will check if a presentation with the same title, speaker, and date already exists to help prevent accidental duplicate entries.

## Editing a Presentation

1.  **Navigate:** Go to the "View Entries" page.
2.  **Find Presentation:** Locate the presentation you want to edit in the list.
3.  **Click Edit:** Click the **Pencil icon** (Edit) next to the presentation entry.
4.  **Modify Details:** You will be taken to the "Add Presentation" form, pre-filled with the presentation's current details. The form title will indicate "Edit Presentation".
    *   Update any fields as needed.
    *   If you choose a new file to upload, it will replace the information about any previously associated file.
5.  **Update Presentation:** Click the "Update Presentation" button to save your changes.
6.  **Cancel Edit:** Click "Cancel" to discard your changes and return to the "View Entries" list.

## Deleting a Presentation

1.  **Navigate:** Go to the "View Entries" page.
2.  **Find Presentation:** Locate the presentation you want to delete.
3.  **Click Delete:** Click the **Trash icon** (Delete) next to the presentation entry.
4.  **Confirm:** A confirmation dialog will appear. Confirm that you wish to delete the presentation.
    **Caution:** Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.

For deleting multiple presentations at once, see [Bulk Deletion](./05-viewing-entries.md#bulk-deletion).
